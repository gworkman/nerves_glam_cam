# 3D Printed Case

This directory contains the STEP files for 3D printing a case for the hardware.

The parts are largely press-fit, but require superglue to stay together. For
parts such as the camera mount, spacers and board holder, placement does not
need to be precise. I glued them down after connecting all cables, to ensure
good cable management.

If you are making your own, here's what you need to print:

| File Name         | Quantity |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Back Plate.step   | 1        |
| Bottom Plate.step | 1        |
| Camera Mount.step | 1        |
| EPD Clamp.step    | 1        |
| Front Plate.step  | 1        |
| Top Plate.step    | 1        |
| PCB Clamp.step    | 2        |
| Spacer 1.step     | 4        |
| Spacer 2.step     | 4        |
